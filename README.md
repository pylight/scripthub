==================

* Author:    Sven K. (<admin@ganz-sicher.net>)
* Description: This repo contains a collection of small scripts I wrote. :)
 

Stable scripts for productive use 
---------------------------------

* [runUrxvt.sh](https://github.com/pylight/scripthub/blob/master/bash/runUrxvt.sh) - a script to start urxvt in a new tab instead of a new window
* [dailybak.sh](https://github.com/pylight/scripthub/blob/master/bash/dailybackup) - A backup script using [rsnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org/) to bakup your data periodicly (e.g. every day). 
You can put this into your /etc/cron... directory. It uses notify-send to send a notification about the backup status to the desktop user. Here's how this looks like on Gnome 3:
